# Arabic-GEC
Neural-based automatic Arabic Grammar Error Correction (AGEC) model based on sequence-to-sequence multi-heads attentions Transformer. Initially, we introduce a an unsupervised method to generate a large-scale synthetic dataset based on confusion function to increase the amount of training set.
